49. Group AnagramsSolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesGiven an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

Â 
Example 1:


Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Explanation:


	There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
	The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
	The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.



Example 2:


Input: strs = [""]

Output: [[""]]


Example 3:


Input: strs = ["a"]

Output: [["a"]]


Â 
Constraints:


	1 <= strs.length <= 104
	0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
	strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

return all groups of strings that are anagrams.

i.e. if we have two groups of strings that are anagrams we have to return two goups of strings, i.e. we need List<List<String>>. But in the problem description the method signature is given by List<String>. Does it mean that we always assume that we have only one group of string every time? Can someone please clarify this for me?Â Read more176123434Copyright Â© 2025 LeetCode. All rights reserved.
